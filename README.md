# Antlia
**A collection of functions for [Hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra/).**

Antlia is a group of extensions for Hydra. Current scripts add functionalities for geometry, coloring, coding of math functions and interactivity with the use of both mouse and keyboard.

*If you're here just for the documentation click [here](https://github.com/ritchse/hydra-antlia/blob/master/doc/).*

## How to use

You'll have use [hydra's external scripts functionality](https://github.com/ojack/hydra#loading-external-scripts) as such:

```javascript
await loadScript("https://url/to/antlia/script.js")

//...code
```

Public links to the extensions coming soon! You can just copy and paste from the files as of now.

## Why Antlia?
If you're wondering about the name, *Antlia* is the south-bordering constelation of *Hydra*. If you're wondering why I made Antlia, here it is:

* **Doing geometric stuff in pure Hydra can get really tedious.** And it makes sense, after all Hydra is inspired by analog modular synthesizers. I started Antlia after trying to draw some flags inside Hydra and realizing how the analog-signal way of thinking it's so counter intuitive for that specific goal.
* **I want to code more, think less.** Having to think mathematically about the functions you're going to use can get frustrating when you don't get the expected results, same goes with trying to form RGB colors inside your head.
* **I love colors.** I love colors.
* **Interacting with Hydra with mouse and keyboard is so fun,** it feels like a superpower, so I wanted to make it easier to achieve that.
